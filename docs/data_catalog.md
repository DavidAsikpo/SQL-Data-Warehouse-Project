# üìä Gold Layer Data Catalogue

## üìñ Overview  

The **Gold Layer** of the data warehouse represents the **curated, business-ready data**.  
Unlike the Bronze Layer (raw ingestion) and the Silver Layer (cleaned and standardized data), the Gold Layer provides **aggregated, enriched, and analytics-friendly tables** designed to support **reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics**.  

- **Purpose**: To deliver **trusted, high-quality data** for decision-making across business units (sales, marketing, product, customer insights).  
- **Structure**: Tables are **modeled around business entities** (customers, products, sales, KPIs) and include **derived fields** (e.g., age, average order value, top products).  
- **Caution**: Since the Gold Layer depends on Silver, any **schema changes in Silver** must be reflected in Gold transformations to avoid data quality issues.  

This catalogue documents the **Gold Layer tables**, their columns, data types, and business meaning.
